One day, a crocodile came out of the river. He swam up to the tree and told the monkey that he had travelled a 
long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry.

The kind monkey offered him a few rose apples. 
The crocodile thanked him and asked him if he could visit the monkey again.


The monkey happily accepts and rides the crocodile's back to reach the middle of the river. However, the crocodile cannot lie to him and tells him about his wife's plan.
